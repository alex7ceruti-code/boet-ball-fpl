## üî• **Braai Rating (Consistency Score)**

### **What It Measures**
A player's reliability and consistent point-scoring ability (0-100 scale). Higher scores = more dependable for your starting XI.

### **Calculation Formula**
```javascript
braaiRating = Math.min(100, (form * 15) + (valueScore * 2))

Where:
- form = player's recent form (official FPL average points over last 4 games)
- valueScore = (total_points / now_cost) * 10
```

### **Data Sources**
- **Primary**: Official FPL API (`bootstrap-static`)
- **Fields Used**:
  - `form` - FPL's calculated form score
  - `total_points` - Season total points
  - `now_cost` - Current player price (in 0.1m units)

### **Example Calculation**
```
Player: Mohamed Salah
- Form: 6.2 (average points last 4 games)
- Total Points: 180
- Current Price: ¬£13.0m (130 in API)
- Value Score: (180 / 130) * 10 = 13.8
- Braai Rating: min(100, (6.2 * 15) + (13.8 * 2)) = min(100, 93 + 27.6) = 100
```

### **Update Frequency**
- **Real-time**: Updates after every gameweek as FPL updates official stats
- **Typical Delay**: 2-4 hours post-match for stats confirmation

### **Reliability Assessment**
- **High (85-90%)** - Based on official FPL data
- **Strengths**: 
  - Uses proven FPL form algorithm
  - Accounts for both performance and value
  - Responsive to recent performances
- **Limitations**: 
  - Form is backward-looking (last 4 games only)
  - Doesn't account for fixtures difficulty ahead
  - Can be skewed by one exceptional/poor game

### **Interpretation Guide**
- **90-100**: Elite consistency (Braai Bankers) - Set and forget
- **70-89**: Very reliable - Good for captain consideration  
- **50-69**: Moderate consistency - Rotation option
- **30-49**: Inconsistent - Avoid for important games
- **0-29**: Highly unreliable - Budget fodder only

## üí∞ **Biltong Value (Budget Efficiency)**

### **What It Measures** 
How many points a player delivers per million spent (0-100 scale). Higher scores = better value for money.

### **Calculation Formula**
```javascript
biltongValue = Math.min(100, valueScore * 8)

Where:
- valueScore = (total_points / now_cost) * 10
```

### **Data Sources**
- **Primary**: Official FPL API (`bootstrap-static`)
- **Fields Used**:
  - `total_points` - Season total points
  - `now_cost` - Current player price

### **Example Calculation**
```
Player: Ollie Watkins
- Total Points: 120
- Current Price: ¬£9.0m (90 in API)
- Value Score: (120 / 90) * 10 = 13.3
- Biltong Value: min(100, 13.3 * 8) = min(100, 106.4) = 100
```

### **Update Frequency**
- **Real-time**: Updates after every gameweek

  - Objective metric based on actual returns
  - Immediately reflects price changes
  - Easy to understand and verify
- **Limitations**:
  - Historical performance doesn't guarantee future returns
  - Doesn't consider injury status or minutes risk
  - Early season sample sizes can be misleading

### **Interpretation Guide**
- **85-100**: Outstanding value - Priority targets
- **70-84**: Good value - Solid budget picks
- **50-69**: Fair value - Consider alternatives
- **30-49**: Poor value - Overpriced
- **0-29**: Terrible value - Avoid unless essential

## üí• **Klap Potential (Big Haul Probability)**

### **What It Measures**
Likelihood of explosive scoring performances (0-100 scale). Higher scores = more capable of massive gameweeks.

### **Calculation Formula**
```javascript
klapPotential = Math.min(100, (xGI90 * 25) + (creativity / 10))

Where:
- xGI90 = (expected_goals + expected_assists) per 90 minutes
- creativity = FPL's creativity index
```

### **Data Sources**
- **Primary**: Official FPL API (`bootstrap-static`)
- **Fields Used**:
  - `expected_goals` - Season expected goals
  - `expected_assists` - Season expected assists  
  - `minutes` - Total minutes played
  - `creativity` - FPL creativity index

### **Example Calculation**
```
Player: Bukayo Saka
- Expected Goals: 8.2
- Expected Assists: 6.1
- Minutes: 2340 (26 full games)
- xGI90: ((8.2 + 6.1) / 2340) * 90 = 5.5
- Creativity: 850
- Klap Potential: min(100, (5.5 * 25) + (850 / 10)) = min(100, 137.5 + 85) = 100
```

### **Update Frequency**
- **Real-time**: Updates after every gameweek with new xG/xA data
- **Data Source**: Official FPL provides xG/xA in their API

### **Reliability Assessment**
- **Moderate-High (70-80%)** - Based on advanced statistics
- **Strengths**:
  - Uses cutting-edge xG/xA metrics
  - Incorporates creativity (key pass data)
  - Predictive rather than purely historical
- **Limitations**:
  - xG models have inherent uncertainty (~15-20%)
  - Small sample sizes early in season
  - Doesn't account for penalty takers (separate xG category)
  - Team tactical changes can affect individual xG

### **Interpretation Guide**
- **85-100**: Elite haulers - Captain material in good fixtures
- **70-84**: High potential - Strong differential options
- **50-69**: Moderate potential - Solid picks with upside
- **30-49**: Limited potential - Steady but unspectacular
- **0-29**: Low potential - Unlikely to deliver big scores

## üìà **Form Trend Analysis**

### **What It Measures**
Whether a player's recent form is improving, declining, or stable compared to their season average.

### **Calculation Logic**
```javascript
if (form > points_per_game * 1.2) return 'rising'
if (form < points_per_game * 0.8) return 'falling'  
return 'stable'

Where:
- form = average points last 4 games (official FPL)
- points_per_game = total_points / games_played
```

### **Data Sources**
- **Primary**: Official FPL API (`bootstrap-static`)
- **Fields Used**:
  - `form` - Recent form score
  - `points_per_game` - Season average

### **Example Calculation**
```
Player: Son Heung-min
- Current Form: 7.8 (last 4 games average)
- Season PPG: 5.2
- Comparison: 7.8 vs (5.2 * 1.2 = 6.24)
- Result: 7.8 > 6.24 = 'rising' ‚ÜóÔ∏è
```

### **Update Frequency**
- **Weekly**: Updates after each gameweek
- **Rolling Window**: Always uses most recent 4 games

### **Reliability Assessment**
- **Moderate (65-75%)** - Short-term predictive power
- **Strengths**:
  - Quick to identify hot/cold streaks
  - Based on actual recent performances
  - Simple to understand and act upon
- **Limitations**:
  - Small sample size (4 games)
  - Can be influenced by fixture difficulty
  - Form streaks often revert to mean

## üîÑ **Rotation Risk Analysis**

### **What It Measures**
Likelihood of a player being rotated/benched based on recent playing time patterns.

### **Calculation Logic**
```javascript
avgMinutes = total_minutes / games_started

if (avgMinutes >= 80) return 'low'     // Nailed starter
if (avgMinutes >= 60) return 'medium'  // Mostly plays
return 'high'                          // Rotation risk
```

### **Data Sources**
- **Primary**: Official FPL API (`bootstrap-static`)
- **Fields Used**:
  - `minutes` - Total minutes played
  - `starts` - Number of games started

### **Example Calculation**
```
Player: Erling Haaland
- Total Minutes: 2250
- Games Started: 25
- Average: 2250 / 25 = 90 minutes per start
- Risk Level: 90 >= 80 = 'low' ‚úÖ
```

### **Update Frequency**
- **Weekly**: Updates after each gameweek
- **Immediate**: Reflects latest team selection patterns

### **Reliability Assessment**
- **High (80-85%)** - Based on factual playing time
- **Strengths**:
  - Objective measure of manager trust
  - Immediately reflects rotation patterns
  - Critical for transfer decisions
- **Limitations**:
