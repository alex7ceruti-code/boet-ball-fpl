## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**Player Not Found**:
```bash

üîç Multiple players found for "Johnson":
   1. Johnson (Arsenal) - ID: 27
   2. Johnson (Brighton) - ID: 145
   Using: Johnson (Arsenal)
```
**Solution**: Use player IDs for exact matches

**Empty Fixture Data**:
```
Fixture Rating: Unknown (3.0/5)
