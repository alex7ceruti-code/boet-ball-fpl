**Let's Talk GW1: It's Game On!**

🗓️ **Deadline**: Friday, 15 August @ 20:30 SAST  
📍 **Opening Fixture**: **Liverpool vs Bournemouth** at Anfield  
Other bangers in GW1:
- **Man United vs Arsenal** – battle of the big guns, and a major early test for both sides
- **Chelsea vs Leicester** – Jackson and Palmer look to start strong against newly promoted Foxes
- **Man City vs Southampton** – classic early-season points haul for the Citizens?

**Popular FPL Picks for GW1**
- **Midfield Madness**: Salah (LIV), Palmer (CHE), and Saka (ARS) are trending big
- **Budget Bargains**: Gusto (CHE), Areola (WHU), and Ferguson (BHA) are flying off the shelves
- **Template Trio**: Haaland, Salah, and Saka are the new holy trinity — but boet, where's the differential?

**New FPL Rules You Need to Know (2025/26 Edition):**
- 📈 **Bonus Points Overhaul**: Defensive actions now rewarded more — tackles, clearances, and blocks all count! Lekker for fullbacks.
- 🧠 **8 Chips Total**: Yes boet, you read right. *Bench Boost*, *Triple Captain*, *Wildcard* still around. But no more *Assistant Manager* chip.
- 🌍 **Elite Global Leagues**: New leagues for top managers globally — time to show the world how we do it in SA!

- ✅ Check pre-season lineups & injury news — e.g. Haaland had a knock but looks good now
- ✅ Avoid panic picks — don't go full chop just because your mate picked Bowen "for vibes"
